// INSTRUCTIONS
//
// This exercise will show you a simple usage of useReducer
// Note: this is absolutely overkill, but it's good for learning.
//
// In Exercise.js, we have a Counter component.
// Counter displays a button, which increments a count when clicked.
//
// It is fully functional using useState.
//
// Lets refactor it to use useReducer instead.
//
// The (arbitrary) API I want is:
// the dispatch function accepts a number, and the counter increases by that number
